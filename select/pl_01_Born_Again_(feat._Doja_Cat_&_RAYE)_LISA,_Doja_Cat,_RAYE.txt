(Ooh) if you tried
just a little more times,
I would've made you a believer
Would've showed you what
it's like (I would've
showed you)
Every single night (night)
In the car, top down,
black shades on, uh (uh)
(lookin' so good, can I add?)
And I just broke
up with my man like,
mm (a very, very silly,
silly man)
One ex in the passenger
seat 'cause I'm done (done,
yeah) (never, ever goin' back)
Down, down, rude boy,
get your foot up on my dash
Got all the receipts,
I'm a businesswoman
Little bit of heartbreak
A little bit of:
How could you do that?
A little bit of talkin'
out your ass
A little bit of:
Look at what you had but
could not hold
And that's on you, baby, too bad
I'm about to make it heard as
I vroom-vroom
Ice-cold how I leave you
'lone, but please
Tell your mother
I'ma miss her so
If you tried just
a little more times,
I would've made you a believer
Would've showed you
what it's like (like)
Every single night (night)
To be born again, baby,
to be born again
If you stayed just
another few nights,
I could've made you pray
to Jesus
Would've showed you
to the light (to the light)
Every single night (every night)
To be born again, baby,
to be born again
Non-believer
You've bitten from the
fruit but can't give back
Nice to leave ya
But I would be a fool not to ask
Do your words seem gospel
to ya now? (Your words
seem gospel to you now?)
Keepin' me strong
Choosin' to carry on after one
Too many lies would be wrong,
so wrong
Said, he popped tags
on my shoppin' spree
Stayed mad when
I showed him all the long
receipts
They laugh, but you
crash out  like a comedy
I can't be your sugar mom,
get a job for me, shit
(Ah, so) boy, let go
Or let me live happily
forever after more
I hope you learned somethin'
from a lil' fiasco
You played the game
smart lettin' lil' me pass
go 'cause
If you tried just
a little more times,
I would've made you a believer
Would've showed you what
it's like (like)
Every single night (night)
To be born again, baby,
to be born again
If you stayed just another
few nights, I could've
made you pray to Jesus
Would've showed you
to the light (to the light)
Every single night (every night)
To be born again, baby,
to be born again
Seasoned like the cinnamon
the way I'm gettin' rid of him
I'm only gonna make you
need religion at the minimum
And I'ma do it diligent,
I'm lookin' for a synonym
I'm tryna find the words
to tell him I ain't
even feelin' him
(I pray) don't ever
let me be deficient in
Wish that you could
wake up and then take me
like a vitamin
I learned the hard way
to let go now to save
my soul (oh)
If you tried just
a little more times,
I would've made you a believer
Would've showed you what
it's like (like)
Every single night
To be born again, baby,
to be born again
If you stayed just
another few nights,
I could've made you pray
to Jesus
Would've showed you
to the light (to the light)
Every single night (every night)
To be born again, baby,
to be born again
Baby, to be born, oh, baby,
baby, to be born again
To be born again, baby,
to be born again
Baby, to be born,
oh, baby, baby, to be
born again (yeah)
To be born again, baby,
to be born again
